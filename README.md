# Final-internship
In this internship we have explored  a state of the art method for recommendation systems on Netflix named RecVAE,  then we have preprocessed the MovieLens20M, Netflix and Million Songs datasets  to set up our experimentations on this preprocessed datasets. The final goal from our  experimentations is to retrieve the users embeddings of the three datasets. A user embedding is a 200 dimensional vector that describe the content that the RecVAE  system will recommend to each user  in the dataset. Then after retrieving the users embeddings,  we have analyzed their distribution type  in a 200 dimensional space to moved on finally to build a timestamped trace for users-embeddings for similarity caching experiments.
